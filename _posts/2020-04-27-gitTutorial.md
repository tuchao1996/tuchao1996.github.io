# 简介

[Wiki中git的简介](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software 
development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track 
changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, 
non-linear workflows.
